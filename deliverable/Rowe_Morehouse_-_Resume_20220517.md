    *   <ins>Origin Story</ins>: After 2 years selling web advertising for other firms, I realized that most small businesses in your local yellow pages didn't understand the value of online marketing â€” due to its complexities and array of options.

    *   I architected a scrappy toll-free phone number and call-tracking system using open source software and spreadsheets. I also built a semi-automated billing system that integrated with authorize.net.
