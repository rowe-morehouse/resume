A cookie is a very small file that is deposited on your computer when you visit a website. It's meant to help you. It saves your preferences for the site. For example, whether you are registered or not, if you're signed in, or if you prefer dark mode, or light mode, etc. Cookies are really not that scary … you shouldn't really worry about them. They never contain any of your personally identifiable information, and you can always delete them. If you do delete a cookie, the site will create a new one when you log back in, but you'll have lost your preferences — which is kind of like starting over in a way. To keep my browser running smoothly I delete ALL my cookies every so often, but I know I'm going to have do some set-up afterward.

https://basezero.com — (Marketing Consultant, Director of Marketing role) 

Totally groundbreaking product and I admire the mission. Airtable really is a "lego kit" that non-coders can use to multiply their productivity 10x. Also, there are so many potential use cases for so many different types of businesses. Combined with automations and the marketplace apps, you can really do anything with it. It's a great product that never gets boring — I'm sure users surprise you all the time with what they build. Plus the the funding. That's stability right there. Quite a runway.

Feel free to add any additional information here. :)

Was using an Airtable questionnaire created by and organization I volunteer for, and I decided to look at the careers page because I am looking for contract work. 

Any other previous work experiences that might be relevant to this role?
