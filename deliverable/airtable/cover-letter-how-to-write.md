cover letter notes:

A cover letter explains who you are, lists major accomplishments, and tells the hiring manager what you hope to bring to the company if hired.

the application cover letter, the prospecting cover letter, and the networking cover letter.

Include your full name, address (including zip code--for ATS purposes) and phone number with area code. You should make it as easy as possible for the hiring manager to reach you.

Think of the opening as your “hook”. It’s your chance to pull the hiring manager in. How exactly do you write a good hook? Think about what skills set you apart from the other candidates or how your experience would make you invaluable to the company. What can you do that nobody else can?

Don’t go overboard with information in your opening, though. Pick just the one or two things you think are the most relevant and most important to this particular job.

When writing the body of your cover letter, remember the three w’s: why, what and what

1. Why are you writing?
2. What can you offer?
3. What do you know about the company and the team?

1. It tells a story about yourself
2. It shows your value concretely
3. It calls the recruiter to action


The body of the cover letter is all about selling yourself. Include a couple of examples of relevant and measurable accomplishments. Measurable accomplishments are powerful because they show proof of your abilities.

For example, if you’re applying for a job in sales, you might include, “In Q4 of 2015, I increased sales by 15%”.

Or, if you’re applying for a job in web development, you might say, “Worked on a team of three developers to build out full mobile app”.

Someone in a managerial position could say, “Led a team of 15 to reach a combined $250,000 in sales in one quarter”. Just like when writing a resume, your cover letter should only include the most relevant and positive information about you

The closing of your cover letter is just that, a closing. It should be used to thank the hiring manager for his or her time and to mention any attachments (resume, portfolio, samples). Keep the closing professional, and try not to sound too eager, since eagerness can come off as desperate.

For example, rather than saying something like, “Looking forward to hearing more about the position”, but it’s best to keep it cool with something like, “I look forward to finding out if I’m a match for this position”.

To finish out the closing, do a formal signature. You can use “Sincerely,” “Best,” “Regards,” “Yours,” or any other professional signoff.
Use your first and last name as your signature, and send from a personal email account that does not list your current work signature beneath the email.

1. State your name
2. Say hello
3. Explain your work history
4. Tell them what you can do for their company
5. Say goodbye

subeject line: use it to sell yourself. Ex: “Experienced Software Engineer Seeks Senior Level Mobile Position.”

Keep your cover letter short and to the point. The hiring manager will be reading lots of cover letters. Make yours stand out with as little text as possible.
Be confident. Let the hiring manager know the reasons why you deserve this position and make yourself believe them too!
Don’t simply rephrase your resume. Let your personality show and go into further detail about your most valuable skills and experiences.
Do your research before writing the cover letter. It should be customized to that specific company’s values and needs. Hiring managers can spot a generic resume from a mile away.
Use the job posting as your guide for what topics to focus on.
Include keywords from the job posting. Applicant tracking systems may scan your cover letter along with your resume.
Check for spelling and grammar errors.
Send your cover letter as a PDF to avoid readability issues.

You should always address the person on the other end by name. Check out the company website or call the company’s office manager to inquire about the name of the hiring manager. Never use “To Whom It May Concern” or “Hi” in place of a name. If all else fails, use “Hi Company Name.”

If it is not specified, a cover letter can be sent either as an attachment (PDF is best) or in the body of an application email with your resume attached.

Start a cover letter by introducing yourself by name and a greeting. For example, “Hello Mary, I’m Paige Doepke.”
