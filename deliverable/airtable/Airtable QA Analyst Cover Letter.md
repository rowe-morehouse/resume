Airtable
155 5th St, 7th Floor
San Francisco CA 94103


Hi, can I please ask to be considered for the contract QA Analyst position?

Airtable is a genius idea and the product has so many potential use cases for so many different personas. For example, it's instantly useful for managing remote-first workflows. I'm sure the growth team realized this as soon as the pandemic hit. 

I'm not sure what type of experiments you guys are working on, but I can tell you I'm a very competent QA Analyst and I am looking for a remote contract position. Airtable is pretty world-class and I'd love to bring my product, UI, and debugging skills to contribute to mission of democratizing software creation.  

I am very much accustomed to remote working and I'm good with Cypress. I fit right in with developers; I see QA as a service role where I am trying to help them pass integration tests and ship code.

I'll have to come up to speed on product knowledge, but besides that, nobody's going to have to hold my hand. I know exactly what you're doing and how QA integrates into supporting your A/B tests, end-to-end. I'd be happy to come to SF for an interview. :)

Shift left,
