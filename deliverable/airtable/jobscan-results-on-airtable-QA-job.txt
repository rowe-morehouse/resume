1. Hard skills
2. Education level (only when an advanced degree is included in the job description)
3. Job title
4. Soft skills
5. Other keywords

Create a visually appealing resume to engage the recruiter long enough to see your skills and qualifications to yield more invitations to interview.

Greenhouse uses the frequency of a skill to determine search result rankings.

Make sure important hard skills appear more frequently
in your resume.

Greenhouse does not recognize different tenses, abbreviations, or acronyms of skills and keywords. Tailor your resume keywords to be an exact match to what is found in the job description. If you have room in your resume, add variations of keywords to account for recruiter searches.

ATS and recruiters prefer specific date formatting for your work experience.

Try to match the job title exactly

Please use the following formats: “MM / YY or MM / YYYY or Month YYYY” (e.g. 03/19, 03/2019, Mar 2019 or March 2019).

We suggest updating these dates:
