Dear Ms. Hopkins:

I found your posting on Monster for a network administrator and knew I wanted to apply immediately. ABC Corporation’s reputation for responsive service and proactive support differentiates your company from the rest, and I would like to be part of your dynamic team.

Since graduating from XYZ College with a BS in computer science, I have worked for three years as a network administrator for DEF Company. In this role, I am valued as a solutions-focused manager of networks, IT systems, user support functions and technology projects. I have experience in all areas covered in your job ad, including:

- Network and Server Design and Administration
- LAN, WAN, VPN, SAN and VoIP Infrastructure
- Network Analysis and Optimization
- System Security, Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plans
- Cloud Computing and Data Storage
- Enterprise System and Software Implementations

Known as a keen technical trouble-shooter, I am dedicated to providing cost-effective and expedient solutions optimizing network stability and security; improving performance of systems and equipment; and resolving issues such as network crashes, system slowdowns and virus outbreaks.

At DEF Company, I provide world-class service technical support in an enterprise environment, and I am confident I would quickly become a productive network administrator at ABC Corporation. If you agree, please call me at (555) 555-5555 to set up an interview.

I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

Barbara Holt

I worked directly with Rowe and the project teams he managed while I was GM and Director of Strategy at Razorfish. Rowe's skills on the PM side were top notch, he understood technology and was great at motivating teams, a rare combination. He also contributed deep thinking on design and creative sides, another highly exceptional quality in a technical PM. Overall, he really "got" all sides of the implementation and was able to effectively lead teams to success.

Rowe and I have worked together across a variety of companies and circumstances, and whatever the situation or subject matter, he always has something creative and insightful to add to the mix. A thorough self-starter, he also has the ability to take those ideas and turn them into projects, products, services and companies, and adapt them to changing circumstances.

Faced with a new challenge, Rowe will focus and absorb the necessary information, develop an informed perspective, and deliver a solution which hits the mark. From the big picture to specific detail, I can count on him to ask smart questions and give smarter answers. See less
