**Founder / CEO — Wildwood Hills Search Marketing** &nbsp;_<small>Jan, 2004 - Jan, 2008</small>_

✔︎  Founded this successful business-to-consumer internet advertising agency, and grew it to almost 200 brick-and-mortar clients via a productized service offering and a formalized, documented sales strategy.

*   Origin Story: After a couple years of selling internet advertising for other firms, I realized that most small businesses in your local yellow pages didn't understand the value of online marketing at that time — due to its complexities and overwhelming array of options. They really wanted phone calls from new prospects. I had an epiphany moment and <mark>launched the world's first Pay-Per-Call performance marketing service</mark>.

*   I concepted and put together a toll-free VOIP phone number bank and call tracking system using open-source software and spreadsheets.

*   Our clients loved only having to pay for the phone calls they received … but the key to the success of this business was the smart sales program and my motivating commission structure which attracted top salespeople who I hired and managed.

✔︎  Managed cross-functional, multi-disciplinary project teams for web development engagements w/ budgets ranging from \\$1 to \\$3 million.

*   Full accountability for cost / schedule / quality for the client — and overall P&L for the agency — which required a comprehensive understanding of financial and operational metrics and levers.

*   Learned the necessary <mark>soft-skills to motivate team members</mark> when you have all the responsibility, and no authority.

*   Learned to clarify ambiguous requirements, identify hidden stakeholders, and influence client decisions.

*   Implemented project risk identification practices & change control procedures.

*   Used the best parts of Agile, Scrum, PMI PMBOK, and Rational Unified methodologies.
